# Project 3: Communicate Data Findings
### By: Shimaa Mohammed Badawy

## Dataset

The dataset which is used in this investigation is Loan Data from borrowers, which includes data related to loan proposers such as the amount of loan they have taken, the proposer's rate and the loan status.

## Summary of Findings

From this investigation, it seems that the relation between LoanOriginalAmount and LoanStatusNumeric is weak. The same observation captured for the relation between LoanStatusNumeric and BorrowerRate. That means that completing the loan is not strongly dependent on Loan amount or borrower rate.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the 3 features (amount of loan, loan status and borrowers rates). I start by introducing an overview about the dataset and my observations. Afterwards, I introduce each of the feature's one by one. The first figure is a histogram to discribe the distribution of different loan statuses. Then in the second figure, intruduced another histogram for the distribution of borrowersâ€™ rates. The last figure, descripes the distribution of different loan amount.
